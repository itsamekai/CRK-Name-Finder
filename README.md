## Automate finding available names in Cookie Run Kingdom. 

#### Instructions:
Requires you to be in the add friend page in order to work.

It is recommended that you run **100 ~ 200** at once, it can be hard to stop the script once it starts. 

The results of the available names will be written to a text file which you can use to check through.

--------
#### Limitations:
1. There can be instances where the ctrl+a -> delete can get stuck sometimes. You can fix this midscript by manually intervening and doing ctrl+a.
2. There are some false-positives within the script, but it perhaps could be fixed by adding a higher delay between searches.
3. False-positives within the game is also applicable here. If it is available in the search, it may not be available in the name change part itself. An example would be the name 'Theme'.

TODO: add a way to stop the script with keyboard input and write to text file if available.
